The production and logistics data such as transportation temperatures need to be strictly monitored for vaccines this may have an effect over vaccine effectiveness. There is also a need for auditability to avoid losing any vaccines and in the worst of cases a black market of vaccines.

This POC seeks to leverage the next-generation EOSIO blockchain technology by bringing traceability and transparency, to SARS-Cov-2 vaccine supply chains in Latin America. By providing countries the ability to share verifiable claims with their citizens to improve confidence and authenticity in the vaccination process.


Objective: mitigate future vaccine distribution risks through:
1. Accurate traceperancy and traceability 
Real time data visibility and monitoring of vaccines data such locations , temperatures etc


2. Recall and disposal
Locate and recall products acurately to improve eficiency and reduce waste.

3. Dispute resolutions
Stakeholders can backtrack data and provide evidence for any incident in  the vaccione supply chain.

4. An unique token for each vaccine
Each dose of a vaccine will be labeled with a unique identifying code, and end users can scan the code retrieving a complete history of the product.
